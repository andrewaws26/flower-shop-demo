# 🌸 Flower Price Board – Quick Start

This page shows your flower shop’s prices, pulled directly from a Google Sheet.  
Update the sheet → refresh the page → prices update automatically.

---

## 📝 How to Update Prices
1. Open the Google Sheet (you should have the link).
2. Each row = one flower item.  
   Columns:
   - **Category** → e.g. “Roses” or “Seasonal”
   - **Item** → name of the flower
   - **Price** → price (e.g. `$2.50/stem`)
   - **Notes/Emoji** → optional message or emoji
   - **In Stock** → `true` or `false`
3. Save your changes.  
   ✅ Within about a minute, the web page will refresh with the new info.
